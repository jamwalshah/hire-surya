## Projects

›› **Weather ETL Data Pipeline using Apache Airflow[[Project Link]](https://github.com/jamwalshah/airflow-etl-weather-api-to-postgres)**\
&emsp; Utilized Open-Meteo weather `API` to fetch weather data based on specified location coordinates. Set up `Apache Airflow` in a `Docker` environment using the `Astronomer` framework, Created `Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)` to orchestrate the `ETL pipeline`. Established connections to the API and a `PostgreSQL` database to process and store the fetched data in an `AWS RDS` hosted `PostgreSQL` database. Monitored and debugged the failures by analyzing logs from hourly `scheduled ETL` runs, leading to 15% reduction in the failure rate. As a Proof of Concept(PoC), successfully dumped transformed records into a `PostgreSQL` database hosted on `Azure Database for PostgreSQL` service, demonstrating versatility across cloud platforms. This transformed data is crucial for creating reporting dashboards.

›› **Road Accident Severity Prediction System[[Project Link]](https://github.com/jamwalshah/road_accident_severity_prediction)**\
&emsp; Data on road accidents in the US between 2016 and 2023 was sourced from Kaggle. After basic `EDA` in `pandas` to understand data distribution and identify patterns, data was loaded into `Azure Data Lake Storage` and `transformations` were carried out using `jupyter notebook` and `PySpark` in `Azure Databricks`, and several `Machine Learning` models, such as `Logistic Regression`, `Decision Tree Classifier`, `Random Forest Classifier`, `XG Boost RF Classifier` and `Naive-Bayes Classifier`, `K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier` were applied to forecast the severity of road accidents, along with `visualization` using `Pandas` and `Microsoft Power BI`. Additionally, a web interface is created using `Python Django framework` enabling users to input data and obtain predictions from `Machine Learning models`. Results from different Machine Learning Models were analyzed to tune and improve their performance.

›› **Hospital Management System using Python, MySQL & Streamlit[[Project Link]](https://github.com/jamwalshah/hospitalmanagement_python)**\
&emsp; Created a `Python` based web-application which uses `Streamlit` library for frontend, `Python` for backend and `mysql connector` to connect to `MySQL` database to process the data of patients, their assigned nurses and doctors within a hospital.
