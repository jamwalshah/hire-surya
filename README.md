## Projects

### [Road Accident Severity Prediction System](https://github.com/jamwalshah/road_accident_severity_prediction)

> Data on accidents that happened in the US between 2016 and 2023 was gathered from Kaggle. `EDA` and `transformations` were carried out using `Pandas`, `jupyter notebook`, `PySpark` and `Azure Databricks`, and several `Machine Learning` techniques were applied to forecast the severity of road accidents, along with `visualization` using `Pandas` and `Microsoft Power BI`. Additionally, a web interface is created using `Python Django framework` to give users an interactive UI to input data and obtain predictions from `Machine Learning models`.

### [Hospital Management System using Python, MySQL & Streamlit](https://github.com/jamwalshah/hospitalmanagement_python)

> Created a `Python` based web-application which uses `Streamlit` for frontend, `Python` for backend and `mysql connector` to connect to `MySQL` database to process the data of patients, their assigned nurses and doctors within a hospital
